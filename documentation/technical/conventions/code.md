# Code Conventions

This document provides a set of coding standards and best practices for contributing to the ZinZen project. It aims to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.

### Naming Conventions

Proper naming enhances code readability:

- **General:** Use clear, descriptive names.
- **Variables and Functions:** Use camelCase (e.g., `userProfile`).
- **Components:** Use PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`).
- **Constants:** Use UPPER_CASE (e.g., `MAX_USERS`).
- **Boolean Variables:** Prefix with `is`, `has`, `can` (e.g., `isVisible`).
- **Event Handlers:** Start with `on` or `handle` (e.g., `onClick`).
- **Temporary Variables:** Use context-specific names (e.g., `i` for loops).
- **Type Names:** Use PascalCase (e.g., `User`).

### TypeScript Practices

Follow these TypeScript-specific practices:

- **Type Annotations:** Always use type annotations.
- **Interfaces and Types:** Use interfaces for objects and types for unions.
- **Avoid `any`:** Minimize the use of `any` for better type checking.

### Code Quality and Robustness

To ensure the reliability and maintainability of the code:

- **Simplicity:** Write simple and clear code.
- **Function Size:** Keep functions small and focused.
- **Comments:** Comment complex logic, but prefer self-explanatory code.
- **Modularity:** Ensure changes in one part do not break others.
